        <div class="insights-container">
            <h2>Insights: % Households with SNAP</h2>
            <p>This map highlights the geographic concentration of households relying on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which indicate economic vulnerability and food insecurity.</p>
            <p>Areas with darker shades often correlate with higher unemployment rates, low median household incomes, and limited access to stable employment opportunities. Regions heavily reliant on SNAP may also face challenges such as higher poverty levels, limited access to nutritious food, and overburdened local food systems.</p>
            <p>Interventions such as workforce development programs and initiatives to improve access to affordable, nutritious food could help reduce dependence on government assistance and improve quality of life in these areas.</p>

    <!-- % Without Health Insurance -->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="map-container">
            <iframe src="Pct_noHealthInsurance_map.html" class="map" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
        <div class="insights-container">
            <h2>Insights: % Without Health Insurance</h2>
            <p>This map highlights regions with high proportions of uninsured individuals, often due to cost barriers or employment-related gaps. Darker areas correlate with poorer health outcomes and higher incidences of chronic illnesses.</p>
            <p>Lack of insurance often limits access to preventive care, resulting in higher healthcare costs in emergencies. Expanding Medicaid coverage, subsidizing insurance programs, and providing community health education could significantly improve access to healthcare and health outcomes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insights-container">
            <h2>Insights: % Without Internet Access</h2>
            <p>This map illustrates the digital divide, with darker areas indicating limited access to broadband. These regions face challenges in education, remote work, and telemedicine, often exacerbating existing inequalities.</p>
            <p>Investments in broadband infrastructure, community Wi-Fi zones, and digital inclusion programs could address this gap and enhance access to essential online services.</p>
